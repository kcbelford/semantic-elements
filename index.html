    Semantic elements are basically elements that mean something.
    They clearly define their own meaning to browsers and developers.
    Among other benefits, semantic elements increase a websiteâ€™s
    accessibility, making it easier for people with disabilities to
    interact with a webpage.  The introduction of HTML5 brought several
    new semantic elements to the forefront, leading to the deprecation
    of elements such as div and span.

      <li>aside</li>
