  <h1>Summary of Semantic Elements</h1>
  <h2>By: Kevin Belford</h2>
  <p>
    Semantic elements are basically elements that mean something.  They clearly define their own meaning to browsers and developers.  Among other benefits, semantic elements increase a websiteâ€™s accessibility, making it easier for people with disabilities to interact with a webpage.  The introduction of HTML5 brought several new semantic elements to the forefront, leading to the depreciation of elements such as div and span.  Some of the new semantic elements featured in HTML5 include header, footer, aside and nav.
